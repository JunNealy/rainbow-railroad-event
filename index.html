              Hi! We're a resettlement team working with Rainbow Railroad to help
              resettle Julie Red-Collins, a Ugandan trans woman fleeing to Canada
              later this year. Learn more about rainbow railroad at
              https://www.rainbowrailroad.org/ and Julie's case at
              https://donate.rainbowrailroad.org/team/515983. On August 18th and
              September 15th, we will be working with Storm Crow Manor
              (https://www.stormcrow.com/) to host a series of DnD one shots, with
            </p>
            <p style="color: white;max-width: 50ch;">
              participants registering by paying an entry fee which will go
              towards Julie's fundraising goal. Storm Crow will also be mixing up
              a specialty cocktail just for our event and donating $1 per sale to
              Julie's case. If you’d like to sign up to play in one of our
              campaigns, click the link below to fill out your info. We’re asking
              for a $30 donation to Julie’s cause as an entry fee, but shareable
              appetizers will be provided at Storm Crow, so there will be no other
              costs associated.

                    I've been playing D&D since I was 13. In the dark times of
                    the dreaded THAC0. I love creating worlds and working on my
                    own campaign setting. I'm helping this fundraiser because I
                    want everyone in the LGBTQI+ community to be safe to live
                    their lives without persecution. If I can help, I will help.
                    If I can help by running a D&D game? Hell yes, THAT I know I
                    can do.

                    The children of Vrana are going missing. As new members of
                    the adventurer's guild, you are tasked with finding them and
                    bringing them home, as well as finding the villains
                    responsible. Overall tone: Castlevania style - dark but with
                    patches of humor. Child abduction and dealing with
                    distressed parents may trigger some people.

                  <p>
                    Hi, my name's Chorale and I'm super excited to be here! As a
                    trans woman myself, I'm really happy to be donating my time
                    to the Reading Railroad's cause and specifically to Julie's
                    case. I understand too well the state of minority and danger
                    that a lot of transgender people in the world face and I
                    want to do what I can to help. I love D&D because it's
                    extremely fun and you can accidentally learn a lot about
                    yourself. My GM style is largely improvisational. I love it
                    when my players succeed and fail, and use both instances to
                    drive the story forward.

                    The Setting: Mx. Forrester’s Wayward Home for Abandoned
                    Tieflings. Gratitude Forrester is a retired tiefling
                    adventurer who has opened an orphanage for other abandoned
                    tieflings in their retirement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Players: You are orphan toddlers living at Mx.
                    Forrester’s. Each of you will pick a tiefling subrace. All
                    of your ability scores will be 10, then you can apply your
                    +2 and +1 modifiers to whichever ability scores you like.
                    You will have 4hp, 5 if you boosted your CON modifier. If
                    you reach 0hp you will fall into a nap. Your only abilities
                    will be your racial traits, as a casting tiefling you’ll get
                    the cantrip but no leveled spells. Each of you will start
                    with 1 tool. Your tool must be something reasonably passed
                    off as a toy a toddler might have. Cute baby voices are not
                    required but strongly encouraged.

                    The Mission: The Chaos Crew, the home’s most popular gaggle
                    of toddlers, is recruiting! Your mission is to impress Boss
                    Wobbles by breaking out of the orphanage, going to Mr.
                    Muddlewonk’s Candy Store down the street, and stealing as
                    much candy as you can get. Your minimum goal is to steal one
                    pound of candy for each of you and one pound for the Boss.
                    Also, haunting each of you, is the rumor of Mr. Muddlewonk’s
                    newest creation, the Everlasting Lollipop.
