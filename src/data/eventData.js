I love creating worlds and and working on my own campaign setting, to give you a hint of just how much of a nerd you're dealing with lol Overall, I'm a Storyteller. It's who I am and what I do. I'm helping this fundraiser because I want everyone in the LGBTQI+ community to be safe to live their lives without persecution. If I can help, I will help. If I can help by running a dnd game??

Overall tone of this is Castlevania style. Dark but with patches of humor thrown in. Child abduction and dealing with distressed parents I think would be the only things that may trigger some people.",

      dmInfo:
        "Howdy! My name is Moon, I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons (and other TTRPGs) since high school! I am really passionate about connecting my interest in fantasy to real world positive change. My love for DnD stems from the many worlds, stories and adventures to be had from playing the game. Moreover, you can make many great friends and memories. My style as a DM is very hands off for the roleplay of your character, but I try to keep the game play mechanics for one shots such as this to more simplified mechanics. This is to ensure that every player feels engaged! So I focus on story and roleplay rather than game mechanics! Finally, I want to throw in that I love cats, enjoy energy drinks (especially since I don't drink!) and love meeting new folxs!",

General type of content to be expected and recommended experience level of players: They are no heavy TW for this one, and anything that is borderline I will explain properly or omit depending on how the group feels. This is fully introductory, I am going to focus on base game play mechanics, and try to immerse players in the story and roleplay aspects. People who have never played DnD are welcomed.',

        "Hi, my name's Chorale and I'm super excited to be here! As a trans woman myself, I'm really happy to be donating my time to the Rainbow Railroad's cause and specifically to Julie's case. I understand too well the state of minority and danger that a lot of transgender people in the world face and I want to do what I can in order to help. I love D&D because not only is it extremely fun, but in playing it you can accidentally learn a lot about yourself. I would have to say my style as a GM is largely improvisational. I love it when my players succeed as much as I love it when my players fail, and can use both instances to drive the story forward. Nothing frustrates me more as a GM than seeing my players mired in failure with no way forward. I hope you're as excited about this event as I am, and I hope to see you at my table!",

        'Mx. Forrester’s Wayward Home for Abandoned Tieflings. Gratitude Forrester is a retired tiefling adventurer who has opened an orphanage for other abandoned tieflings in their retirement. (\n) You are orphan toddlers living at Mx. Forrester’s. Each of you will pick a tiefling subrace. All of your ability scores will be 10, then you can apply your +2 and +1 modifiers to whichever ability scores you like. You will have 4hp, 5 if you boosted your CON modifier. If you reach 0hp you will fall into a nap. (If a grown up finds you napping they will take you back to Mx. Foresters.) Your only abilities will be your racial traits, as a casting tiefling you’ll get the cantrip but no leveled spells. Each of you will start with 1 tool. Your tool must be something reasonably passed off as a toy a toddler might have (Get creative, think Rugrats here, a toy screwdriver or mallet, a red pull-wagon, a stuffed bear with a nanny-cam, etc.) Cute baby voices are not required but strongly encouraged. (\n) The Chaos Crew, the home’s most popular gaggle of toddlers, is recruiting! Your mission is to impress Boss Wobbles by breaking out of the orphanage, going to Mr. Muddlewonk’s Candy Store down the street, and stealing the boss (and yourselves) as much candy as you can get your hands on. Your minimum goal is to steal one pound of candy for each of you and one pound for the Boss. That should impress her enough that she’ll let you join The Crew. How you manage this is up to you. Also, haunting each of you, is the rumour of Mr. Muddlewonk’s newest creation, the Everlasting Lollipop.',

I'm cis, but I can't ignore how much of the world uses queer and especially trans people as convenient scapegoats, so I'm excited for this chance to spread a little joy and raise money for this great cause. I love D&D because it's tailor made for us to express and discover ourselves creatively and in community. As a DM I like to give players agency and real choices, even in one shots. Then I love to be surprised by what they do.",

        "Peace in the Feywild is finally assured by upcoming nuptials between Seeley and Unseeley courts. When asked for comment, the Goblin King enthusiastically declared that “you remind me of the babe” but refused to elaborate. Baba Yaya was more subdued, commenting (between picking her teeth with what was probably a chicken bone) “I don't know about marriage of the century, things can be a bit wibbly wobbly around here. I'm mostly looking forward to the hors d’oeuvres.” What could possibly go wrong?? No special experience needed– the DM willl adapt the game to the players. This game is set in the Feywild (D&D’s Elfland), but I lean towards the darker side of Faerie: less Disney, more traditional stories and ballads, but definitely not as dark as Pan’s Labyrinth (for example).",
